I am currently a student at Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT) studying Software Development. I have experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and I'm always looking to learn more. As a software development student, I am passionate about creating innovative solutions through programming. I enjoy the challenge of tackling complex problems and finding elegant ways to solve them. Through my studies, I am learning a variety of programming languages and am (trying) to learn frameworks along the way, as well as developing skills in problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication. As I continue to grow as a developer, I look forward to exploring new technologies and contributing to the ever-evolving world of software development.

🌱 I’m currently learning Ruby, eventually adding a framework on top of it to utilize Ruby on Rails for making full-stack applications <br>
🔭 I’m currently working on a weather application that fetches a weather API to display the data of the city the user enters in <br>
